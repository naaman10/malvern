          <p class="grey-text">I started work in the travel industry after university, where I did a degree in Indian History. This first role was with Cox and Kings and I worked for them in the UK, Russia and India for nearly 10 years.</p>
          <p class="grey-text">I have since grown and managed companies in the travel industry and set up a consultancy to support the industry on sustainability.</p>
          <p class="grey-text">I returned to Cox & Kings over 4 years ago, under which I subsequently established the Malvern Group.</p>
          <p class="grey-text">Across my career I have enjoyed creating new products, including a luxury steam train in Russia, award-winning carbon management software and walking trips in the Indian Himalayas, as well as transforming a number of companies. Above all, I enjoy working with people to make things happen.</p>
